# Traffic-analysing-AI-
Write an AI to identify which traffic sign appears in a photograph.

Background :
As research continues in the development of self-driving cars, one of the key challenges is computer vision, allowing these cars to develop an understanding of their environment from digital images. In particular, this involves the ability to recognize and distinguish road signs – stop signs, speed limit signs, yield signs, and more.
Use TensorFlow to build a neural network to classify road signs based on an image of those signs. To do so, you’ll need a labeled dataset: a collection of images that have already been categorized by the road sign represented in them.
Several such data sets exist already , but for this project , i have used the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) dataset, which contains thousands of images of 43 different kinds of road signs. 

𝘾𝙤𝙣𝙘𝙚𝙥𝙩𝙨 :
1 , Artificial neural network: mathematical model for learning inspired by biological neural networks.
2 , Multilayer neural network: artificial neural network with an input layer, an output layer, and at least one hidden layer.
3 , Deep neural network: neural network with multiple hidden layer.
4 , Dropout : temporarily removing units - selected at random - from a neural network to prevent over-reliance on certain units.
5 , Image convolution : applying a filter that adds each pixel value of an image to its neighbors, weighted according to a kernel matrix.
6 Pooling: reducing the size of an input by sampling from regions in the input.
7 , Convolutional neural network: neural networks that use convolution, usually for analyzing images.
8 , Recurrent neural network: neural network that generates output that feeds back into its own inputs.

𝘼𝙡𝙜𝙤𝙧𝙞𝙩𝙝𝙢𝙨 :
1 , Gradient descent: algorithm for minimizing loss when training neural network.
2 , Backpropagation: algorithm for training neural networks with hidden layers.
